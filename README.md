# .r@ventures (scratch-tw-ratventures-arcade)
This is a simple game made in the [TurboWarp](https://turbowarp.org/) editor, a [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) mod allowing for custom extensions along with other nice quality of life features like the ability to change the FPS limit and a search function for blocks, which also exports in a variety of ways.

You can download the source ".sb3" file from this repository to open it inside TurboWarp and also play the full game on my [website](https://phiskits.wtf/games/ratventures).

**Note:** opening the project in the regular version of Scratch will result in issues, as the game uses custom extensions only available in TurboWarp.

## Game description
A short and exciting highscore game where you take control of r@, a virus infiltrating the computer of a highly wanted criminal trying to dispose of incriminating evidance. Collect suspicious files to score points, utilize the portals to swap sides, collect powerups and dodge the attacks of the antivirus software trying to eliminate you!

## In-game controls
Use the arrow keys or A/D to move left and right. Hold down 'S' to enter turbo mode. Once r@ is fully charged, press 'W/Up Arrow/Space' to unleash a powerful shockwave
